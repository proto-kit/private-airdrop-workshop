# What is a zk-proof?

<v-clicks>

- Mathematical **proof of computation[^1] using public or private inputs**
- Might include a public output too
- Computation might include **signature verification, merkle tree inclusion**, and more!
- To compute a proof, **you need a proof system, we use Kimchi**[^2] (same as MINA L1)
- Proof is a **result of circuit execution** - which determine what constraints create a valid proof
- When a circuit is compiled, we get a prover and a verifier/verification key
- **Validity of a proof can be cheaply verified using a verification key**
- Zero-knowledge-ness is achieved by not exposing the private inputs to the verifier

# Meet o1js, zkDSL for writing circuits

```typescript {all} {lines: true}
import { Experimental } from "o1js";

const counter = Experimental.ZkProgram({
    publicInput: Field,
    publicOutput: Field
    methods: {
        increment: {
            privateInputs: [UInt64, UInt64],
            method: (publicInput: Field, a: UInt64, b: UInt64): Field => {
                const hash = Poseidon.hash(a.toFields());
                publicInput.assertEquals(hash, "Uh-oh, you're using the wrong number!");
                const incremented = a.add(b);
                return Poseidon.hash(incremented.toFields());
            }
        },
    }
})
```

# Running our circuit

```typescript {all} {lines: true}
await counter.compile(); // creates prover & verifier artifacts

let state = UInt64.from(0);
let publicInput = Poseidon.hash(state.toFields());
const by = UInt64.from(1);

const proofOfIncrement = await counter.increment(publicInput, state, by);

// keep track of the state, so we can run counter.increment(...) again
publicInput = proofOfIncrement.publicOutput; // h(state + 1)
state = state.add(by); // state + 1

const verified = await counter.verify(proofOfIncrement); // true
```

# Power of recursive proofs

```typescript {all} {lines: true}
const credential = Experimental.ZkProgram({ ... });
class CredentialProof extends Experimental.ZkProgram.Proof(credential) {}

const counter = Experimental.ZkProgram({
    publicInput: Field,
    publicOutput: Field
    methods: {
        add: {
            privateInputs: [CredentialProof, UInt64, UInt64],
            method: (

                credentialProof.verify(); // yet another computation to prove
                // ... rest of our add() method
            }
        }
    }
})

# How is this helpful for blockchains?

<v-clicks>

- Blockchain is effectively a **spicy distributed database with consensus**
- **Nodes execute user transactions** - authorized intent to perform an action on top of the chain data
- **Results of the transactions are bundled into a block**
- Contents of a **block can be verified by re-executing the contents** of it (transactions)
- This approach imposes certain **_(high?)_ hardware requirements, which in turn impacts decentralization**
- MINA's protocol[^1] takes a novel approach, by **turning the aforementioned processes into circuits**
- **Block is now a single recursive block proof üéâ**
- This allows MINA nodes to **verify the computation that resulted into a block(proof) very cheaply**

# MINA's native L1 smart contracts

---

# Smart contracts on MINA (1/3)

<v-clicks>

- Built using o1js's `SmartContract` (also known as zkApps)
- Smart contract is just a **circuit that produces a proof of its own execution**
- **Executed off-chain**, keeps the L1 node hardware requirements to the "minimum"
- Transactions **don't tell the node "what code to execute" anymore**
- Instead a **transaction contains a list of pre-authorized account updates**
- Pre-authorized either by a signature, or a proof
- **Block producer just verifies the signature/proof** and applies account updates to the chain state
- Applying all account updates results into a block proof ‚úÖ
- This approach results into **potential race conditions, since users have no built-in way of organizing off-chain**

</v-clicks>

# Smart contracts on MINA (2/3)

```typescript {all} { lines: true }
class Counter extends SmartContract {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è storage worth of 8 Fields is available (8*256bits total)
  @state(Field) public commitment = State();

    const hash = Poseidon.hash(a.toFields());
    const commitment = this.commitment.get();
    this.commitment.assertEquals(commitment); // create a precondition

    commitment.assertEquals(hash, "Uh-oh, you're using the wrong number!");

    const incrementedCommitment = Poseidon.hash(incremented.toFields());

    this.commitment.set(incrementedCommitment); // update the on-chain state

# Key-value storage in smart contracts

<v-clicks>

<div>

**Map-like storage is not possible with the L1 smart contracts** out of the box:

```typescript {all} { lines: true}
class Counters extends SmartContract {
  // ‚ùå this is NOT possible with the L1 smart contract
  @state(PublicKey, UInt64) public counters = State();

  @method()
  increment(for: PublicKey, by: UInt64) {}
}
```

</div>


<div>

You can **store a commitment to a merkle tree's root hash** instead:

```typescript {all} { lines: true}
class Counters extends SmartContract {
  // ‚úÖ this is possible with the L1 smart contract
  @state(Field) public countersCommitment = State();

  @method()
  increment(for: PublicKey, by: UInt64) {}
}
```

</div>

# What is a merkle tree?

```mermaid
graph TB;
    A((root))-->B((node))
    A-->C((node));
    B-->E((leaf))
    B-->F((leaf))
    C-->H((leaf))
    C-->I((leaf))

    style I stroke:red,stroke-width: 2px, stroke-dasharray: 6 6;
    style A stroke:green,stroke-width: 2px, stroke-dasharray: 6 6;
    style B stroke:blue,stroke-width: 2px, stroke-dasharray: 6 6;
    style H stroke:blue,stroke-width: 2px, stroke-dasharray: 6 6;
    style C stroke:green,stroke-width: 2px, stroke-dasharray: 6 6;
```

**blue** = provided by a witness,
**red** = provided by you,
**green** = computed by you

TL;DR; a data structure that allows us to **cryptographically verify <br/> that a leaf/node is a part of a tree**,
by computing the root hash using a merkle witness.

---

# MerkleMap to the rescue

<v-clicks>

- Merkle tree leafs can be identified by an index
- If you use a merkle tree with a _depth_ of 256 (size), it means there's 2^256 leafs
- This means the leaf index ranges from 0-2^256, threfore can be repesented by a single field
- You can now think of a tree like of a key-value storage, where key = field, value = field, root = field
- This key-value API is called MerkleMap

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

```typescript {all} { lines: true }
const map = new MerkleMap();
const key = Poseidon.hash(PrivateKey.random().toPublicKey().toFields()) // Field
const value = Poseidon.hash(UInt64.from(1000).toFields()); // Field

// store a hash of values in the tree
map.set(key, value);

const witness = map.getWitness(key); // MerkleMapWitness
const [computedRoot, computedKey] = witness.computeRootAndKey(value); // [Field, Field]
```

</v-clicks>

# Reading tree data

```typescript {all} { lines: true}
class Counters extends SmartContract {
    @state(Field) public countersCommitment = State();

    @method()
    increment(for: PublicKey, by: UInt64) {
        const countersCommitment = this.countersCommitment.get();
        this.countersCommitment.assertEquals(); // precondition to countersCommitment

        const forKey = toField(for); // returns h(for)
        const [forCounter, forCounterWitness] = getCounter(forKey); // returns [UInt64, MerkleMapWitness]

        const [computedCountersCommitment, computedForKey] = 
            forCounterWitness.computeRootAndKey(toField(forCounter));

        // check if the provided data is valid, by checking if its part of the tree
        countersCommitment.assertEquals(countersCommitment, "Uh-oh, invalid root hash!");
        forKey.assertEquals(computedForKey, "Uh-oh, invalid key!");

        // ... rest of the increment logic
    }

```

---

# Updating tree data

```typescript {all} { lines: true}
class Counters extends SmartContract {
    @state(Field) public countersCommitment = State();

    @method()
    increment(for: PublicKey, by: UInt64) {
        // ... our prior increment logic is here

        const newForCounter = forCounter.add(by);
        // compute a new tree root hash, using the new balance as a leaf value
        const [newCountersCommitment] = forCounterWitness.computeRootAndKey(toField(newForCounter));

        // update the on-chain commitment
        this.countersCommitment.set(newCountersCommitment);

        // ... rest of the increment logic
    }

```

---

# Design limitations

<v-clicks>

- Users **execute smart contracts on the client side**, independently of other clients
- This **leads to preconditions pointing to the root hash of the tree**
- If there are **two users transfering at the same time, their preconditions will be the same**
- After **one transaction succeeds, the on-chain state is updated** (commitment changes)
- This **invalidates the second transaction, since it now has an outdated precondition**

</v-clicks>

# Building a private airdrop <br/> on MINA

# Architecture

<v-clicks>

- **Airdrop merkle tree**, stores all addresses eligible for airdrop
- Everyone receives the same amount of tokens from the airdrop
- **Airdrop smart contract**, that tokens can be claimed from only if **the user can prove they are part of the airdrop tree**
- In order to prevent double-claims, we must also **use a cryptographically sound nullifier** that **can't be traced back to the user's address**.

# Protokit

Protocol development framework for privacy enabled application chains <br/>(a.k.a. zkRollups)

```bash {all}
$ npx degit proto-kit/starter-kit#develop my-app-chain
```

---

# What is Protokit?

<v-clicks>

- Typescript based framework for building zkChains
- Not another zkEVM, uses a **custom-tailored zkVM** instead
- **Hybrid execution model**, both off and on chain
- Off-chain execution = **client side zk-proofs** ü§Ø
- **End to end proven execution**, no sequencer operator shenanigans
- Customizable and modular (not monolithic üóø)
- Virtually no learning curve (you should still pay attention tho üëÄ)

</v-clicks>

---

# Build your own zkRollup

<v-clicks>

- **Recursive zk-rollup is a series of recursive circuits**, that prove transaction execution and rollup state transitions
- **L1 offers _sequence state_ and _actions_** to help you build zk-rollups, but **you still have to write your own circuits!**
- Protokit enables developers to **build zero-knowledge, interoperable and privacy preserving application chains** with a minimal learning curve.
- You can **roll your own zkRollup** in a few lines of code.
- **zkRollups are a superset of zkApps**, combining **opt-in privacy features with on-chain execution** for the best-in-class user experience.

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

### What is a Protokit zkRollup made of?

</v-clicks>

<v-clicks>

- **Runtime** = application logic
- **Protocol** = underlying VM, block production, transaction fees, account state, ...
- **Sequencer** = mempool, block production, settlement to L1
- **L1 settlement contract** - an L1 contract validating your rollup's block proofs

</v-clicks>
<v-clicks>

üëÜ You can replace any module of your app-chain, want a different mempool implementation? Just write one!

</v-clicks>
